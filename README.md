ðŸš€ Challenge Solved with Spring Boot: Development of a Demo Music Application ðŸŽ¶
Iâ€™ve just completed a development challenge using Spring Boot, and here Iâ€™m sharing my experience!
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- Spring Boot: Main framework for creating the REST API.
- JPA & Hibernate: For database management and handling relationships between the Singer and Song entities.
- PostgreSQL: Used as the relational database for storing singer and song data, providing robust and reliable storage for the application.
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): For transferring data between the API and the database.
- OpenAI API: Optional integration to retrieve information about singers using artificial intelligence.
ðŸ’¡ Features Implemented:
- Register Singers and Songs: Complete functionality to create and store information about singers and songs in a PostgreSQL database.
- Search by Singer: Allows searching for songs by singer name and retrieving details.
- List All Singers and Songs: Endpoints to display full lists of singers and songs stored in PostgreSQL.
- OpenAI Integration: I added an optional integration to fetch information about a singer through the OpenAI API, opening the door to innovations like automatic artist biography queries. ðŸ¤–
ðŸ”„ Challenges and Learnings:
- Establishing relationships between tables in the database using JPA to manage the one-to-many relationship between Singer and Song.
- Integrating PostgreSQL with Spring Boot to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage singer and song data. The use of PostgreSQL provided a reliable and scalable solution for handling large amounts of data.
- Creating a workflow in the REST API using Spring Boot to handle CRUD operations and enable efficient queries.
- External integration with OpenAI to enhance the user experience by providing additional information about musical artists. ðŸŽ¤
